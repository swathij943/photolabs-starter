# Photolabs
Photolabs is a desktop application built with React, serving as a stock photo gallery. It allows users to view and interact with a collection of photos, providing features such as liking photos, filtering based on topics, and suggesting similar photos.

## Features
- Browse Photos: Users can view photos on the homepage, which are fetched from the API.
- Topic Filtering: Users can navigate to different topics to see photos in different categories.
- Photo Modal: When a user clicks on a photo, a modal opens up, displaying a larger version of the photo and relevant/similar photos.
- Like Photos: Users can like a photo from anywhere within the application where the photo is displayed.
- Liked Photos Notification: Users can view a heart icon with a notification in the navigation indicating the number of liked photos.
